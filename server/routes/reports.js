Analysis:The original code contains several report generation routes, and the change snippet replaces the `program-effectiveness` report route with a comprehensive `dashboard-metrics` route and adds a route for exporting reports in different formats. It also introduces helper functions for generating monthly metrics, DoD reports, quarterly reports, annual reports, recommendations, and converting data to CSV format. Finally, the intention is to enhance the reporting dashboard with real-time statistics and DoD compliance metrics.

| Sentiment Analysis (AI) | Flag urgent mentor notes (e.g., “Cadet unmotivated”) for follow-up | Prioritize at-risk cadets for intervention | Hugging Face sentiment-analysis pipeline | Saves 1 hr/day by highlighting issues | Prevents negative peer dynamics by addressing behavior early | Cognitive behavioral theory: Early intervention reduces escalation | `const analyzeNote = async (note) => { const classifier = await pipeline('sentiment-analysis'); return classifier(note); };` |
| Inventory Management | Track uniforms, HiSET books, equipment | Prevent stockouts, manage budget | React-admin Kanban, SQLite for Item model | Saves 0.5–1 hr/day by automating checks | Ensures supplies for ~100–200 cadets | Competence (self-determination theory): Reliable resources support cadet success | `interface Item { id: string; name: string; quantity: number; threshold: number; }` |
| Inventory Forecasting (AI) | Predict restocking needs based on usage (e.g., 100 uniforms/cycle) | Avoid shortages, optimize budget | TensorFlow.js for usage prediction | Saves 0.5 hr/day, reduces overordering | Supports cost savings (e.g., KMR move saved utility costs) | Ensures program stability for cadet engagement | `const forecastInventory = (items, days) => items.map(item => ({ ...item, needsRestock: item.quantity - item.usageRate * days < item.threshold }));` |
| Cadet Management | Store profiles (name, age, behavior score, HiSET status) | Track cadet progress, prevent negative peer grouping | React-admin Contacts, SQLite for Cadet model | Saves 1 hr/day by centralizing data | Supports 78% HiSET, 48% workforce outcomes | Social learning theory: Pair high-risk cadets with positive peers | `interface Cadet { id: string; name: string; behaviorScore: number; hiSetStatus: string; }` |
| Behavior Prediction (AI) | Predict risk of conflicts based on behavior scores (1–5) | Proactively manage high-risk cadets | TensorFlow.js for risk scoring | Saves 0.5–1 hr/day by flagging issues | Reduces “bad apples” impact | Cognitive behavioral theory: Early alerts prevent group spoilage | `const predictRisk = (cadet) => tf.sequential().predict([cadet.behaviorScore, cadet.incidents]);` |
| Room Assignment | Assign cadets to rooms based on behavior and natal chart compatibility | Foster positive peer environments | Flatlib for astrology, SQLite for room assignments | Saves 0.5 hr/day, reduces conflicts | Minimizes negative peer influence | Social learning theory: Compatible peers model positive behavior | `const isCompatible = (cadet1, cadet2) => Flatlib.calculate(cadet1.birthData).sun.element === Flatlib.calculate(cadet2.birthData).sun.element;` |
| Supervisor Assignment | Assign staff to cadets based on experience and astrology | Build trust with high-risk cadets | Flatlib for staff-cadet compatibility, SQLite for assignments | Saves 0.5 hr/day, improves mentorship | Enhances outcomes (6% military, 19% education) | Attachment theory: Strong role models guide cadets | `const assignSupervisor = (cadet, staff) => staff.find(s => Flatlib.calculate(s.birthData).sun.element === Flatlib.calculate(cadet.birthData).moon.element && s.experienceYears >= 3);` |
| Reporting Dashboard | Generate stats (mentorship hours, HiSET rates, service hours) | Meet funder requirements (e.g., DoD) | React-admin Dashboard, SQLite queries | Saves 2–3 hr/week on reporting | Tracks 9,000+ service hours, 78% HiSET | Accountability supports program credibility | `const getStats = () => db.query('SELECT COUNT(*) as mentorshipHours, SUM(itemsUsed) as items FROM logs');` |
| Automated Summaries (AI) | Draft reports for funders | Reduce reporting time | Hugging Face GPT-2 for summaries | Saves 2 hr/week | Streamlines DoD reporting | Enhances staff efficiency for cadet focus | `const summarize = async (data) => { const generator = await pipeline('text-generation', 'gpt2'); return generator(Summarize: ${data.mentorshipHours} hours, ${data.itemsUsed} items.); };` |
| Event Management | Schedule service events, recruitment | Coordinate 9,000+ service hours | React-admin Calendar, SQLite for events | Saves 1 hr/week | Supports community engagement | Purpose (self-determination theory): Events foster cadet purpose | `const scheduleEvent = (events, staff) => events.filter(e => staff.some(s => s.availability.includes(e.date)));` |
| Mobile Optimization | Responsive UI for staff/mentor access | Enable on-the-go updates | Tailwind CSS, Workbox for offline support | Saves 0.5 hr/day via mobile access | Supports low-staff mobility | Enhances usability for busy staff | `const config = { responsive: 'min-width: 640px', offline: Workbox.strategy('NetworkFirst') };` |
| Compliance Tracking | Ensure adherence to DoD, health regulations | Avoid legal issues | SQLite for compliance logs, API checks | Saves 1 hr/week on audits | Meets DoD funding requirements | Ensures safe cadet environment | `const checkCompliance = (logs) => logs.every(l => l.meetsDoDStandards);` |

| Module | Functionality | Fields | Features | AI Enhancement | Psychology Alignment | Daily Impact | Code Example |
|--------|---------------|--------|----------|----------------|----------------------|--------------|--------------|
| Staff Scheduling | Manage staff schedules for classes, drills, events | Staff ID, name, role, availability, tasks | Weekly calendar, task assignment, email reminders | Smart scheduling: Suggest available staff | Structured routines reduce cadet stress (self-determination theory) | Saves 0.5–1 hr by avoiding conflicts | `const suggestSchedule = (staff, tasks) => tasks.map(task => ({ task, assigned: staff.filter(s => s.availability.includes(task.time)).slice(0, task.requiredStaff) }));` |
| Mentorship Tracking | Assign mentors, log meetings, track progress | Mentor name, contact, cadet, date, notes, goals | Calendar, reminders, progress reports | Sentiment analysis: Flag urgent notes | Consistent mentorship builds relatedness | Saves 1–2 hr by prioritizing issues | `const analyzeNote = async (note) => { const classifier = await pipeline('sentiment-analysis'); return await classifier(note); };` |
| Inventory Management | Track uniforms, HiSET books, equipment | Item ID, name, quantity, threshold, last restocked | Low-stock alerts, usage logs, reorder requests | Inventory forecasting: Predict restocking needs | Reliable supplies support cadet competence | Saves 0.5–1 hr by automating checks | `const forecastInventory = (items, days) => items.map(item => ({ ...item, projectedStock: item.quantity - item.usageRate * days, needsRestock: item.quantity - item.usageRate * days < item.threshold }));` |
| Cadet Management (Basic) | Store cadet profiles for future features | Cadet ID, name, age, behavior score, HiSET status | Track behavior scores (1–5) | None (future AI for behavior prediction) | Positive peer grouping prevents negative dynamics | Reduces conflicts | `interface Cadet { id: string; name: string; behaviorScore: number; }` |
| Reporting | Generate stats for funders | Mentorship hours, items used, HiSET stats | Dashboard, exportable reports | Automated summaries with GPT-2 | Supports program accountability | Saves 2–3 hr weekly | `const summarize = async (data) => { const generator = await pipeline('text-generation', 'gpt2'); return generator(Summarize: ${data.mentorshipHours} hours, ${data.itemsUsed} items.); };` |
